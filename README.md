# MailTech

## About the Project

The MailTech project is a reporting tool and productivity tracker for a fictitious mailroom operation. The application is intended to be used in a business space and is thus only designed for tablet, laptop and desktop devices that would normally be hardened and locked down for information security reasons. The application allows users to report tasks performed and volumes processed on a daily basis and view a dashboard that gauges their production efficiency based on set criteria. The application allows admins to access volume reports, individual efficiency reports and team efficiency reports driven by user reported volumes and admin reported labor hours. The overall goal for this application is to provide a tool for admins to keep a pulse on the fictitious mailroom operation and for users to have continues feedback on their daily and bi-weekly production goals.
